    .SYNOPSIS
        This scripts take as input a powershell script using the old Azure AD or MSOL PowerShell modules and converts it to use the new Microsoft Graph PowerShell module.

    .DESCRIPTION
        The goal of these scripts to is to leverage the power of GPT4 to speed up and automate the process of migrating scripts from the old Azure AD or MSOL PowerShell modules to the new Microsoft Graph PowerShell module.

    .PARAMETER ScriptPath
        The path to the script to be converted.

    .PARAMETER OutputPath
        The path to the output file. If not specified, the script will be saved in the same folder as the original script.

    .EXAMPLE
        PS> .\Migrate-ScriptToGraphAPI.ps1 -ScriptPath "C:\Scripts\Script1.ps1" -OutputPath "C:\Scripts\Script1-Graph.ps1"
